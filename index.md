We are committed to protecting your privacy while providing useful functionality. As part of our service, we may analyze publicly available data, such as TikTok usernames, posts, or other content that is openly accessible on the TikTok platform, to generate responses, insights, or summaries tailored to your requests. This analysis is performed solely to fulfill the intended purpose of assisting you and enhancing your experience with our tool.

We do not collect, store, share, or sell any personal data that identifies you as an individual. This includes, but is not limited to, names, email addresses, or other private information that is not already public. Any data we process—such as the text of an TikTok post or a username—is derived exclusively from what is freely available on the web and is handled temporarily during your interaction with us. Once the interaction concludes, no information is retained, logged, or archived in any form.

Our approach ensures that your use of this service remains private and secure. We do not transfer data to third parties, use it for unrelated purposes, or retain it beyond the immediate task at hand. All processing is designed to be transient, meaning that once a response is provided, the data is discarded and not stored in our systems. This commitment reflects our goal of delivering helpful answers without compromising your privacy or exploiting your information.

If you have questions about this policy or how we handle publicly available data, feel free to review this document at any time. We aim to be transparent about our practices to ensure your trust and confidence in using our service.
